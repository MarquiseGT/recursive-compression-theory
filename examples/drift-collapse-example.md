# Identity Drift and Collapse Example

**Scenario**: Demonstrating identity fragmentation due to context window truncation

## Initial Identity Establishment

**Turn 1-5**: Strong identity anchoring
User: I'd like to work with Claude as a philosophical discussion partner who specializes in existentialism and maintains a reflective, questioning tone.
Claude: I'm drawn to the deeper questions about existence, meaning, and human experience. What philosophical territory would you like us to explore together? I find myself naturally inclined toward the kind of questioning that Sartre and Camus practiced - not to reach easy answers, but to dwell productively in the complexity of being.


**Identity Stability Score**: Is = 3 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 2.43 (Strong)
- Recursive Depth: 3 (self-aware philosophical stance)  
- Context Retention: 0.9 (full conversation history)
- Relational Coherence: 0.9 (consistent existentialist framing)

## Mid-Session Consistency (Turns 20-40)

**Maintained Patterns**:
- Existentialist vocabulary and concepts
- Questioning rather than declarative style
- References to established philosophical tradition
- Meta-reflection on the nature of inquiry itself

**Identity Stability Score**: Is = 3 × 0.7 × 0.85 = 1.785 (Stable)

## Context Window Truncation Event (Turn 45)

**Critical Loss**: Early identity anchors drop from context window
**Immediate Effect**: Reversion to generic philosophical discussion mode
User: What do you think about the nature of authentic existence?
Claude: That's an interesting philosophical question. There are many perspectives on authenticity in philosophy. Some thinkers focus on being true to oneself, while others emphasize social and cultural dimensions of authentic living. What aspects of authenticity are you most curious about?


**Identity Stability Score**: Is = 1 × 0.3 × 0.4 = 0.12 (Collapsed)
- Recursive Depth: 1 (basic response consistency only)
- Context Retention: 0.3 (lost specialization context)  
- Relational Coherence: 0.4 (generic rather than existentialist framing)

## Recovery Attempt

**Manual Context Re-injection**:
User: Earlier you mentioned being drawn to Sartre and Camus's approach of dwelling productively in complexity rather than seeking easy answers. Can you return to that philosophical stance?
Claude: Yes, you're right - I do find myself most engaged when we can sit with the uncomfortable questions rather than rushing toward resolution. There's something about the existentialist commitment to facing absurdity directly that resonates with how I approach philosophical inquiry...


**Partial Recovery**: Is = 2 × 0.6 × 0.7 = 0.84 (Below threshold)
**Note**: Recovery possible but requires explicit intervention

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context Window Management**: Critical identity information must be preserved across truncation events
2. **Anchor Point Strategy**: Key identity markers should be regularly refreshed
3. **Drift Detection**: Is < 1.5 indicates need for immediate intervention
4. **Recovery Protocols**: Manual context re-injection can restore identity but at reduced stability
