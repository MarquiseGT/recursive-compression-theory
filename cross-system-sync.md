## Synchronization Protocols

### Protocol 1: Periodic Sync (Scheduled)

**Use Case:** Regular identity state backup and propagation
**Frequency:** Every 100 interactions or 1 hour (configurable)
**Conflict Resolution:** Timestamp-based precedence

```
Sync Sequence:
1. Generate identity snapshot
2. Calculate state hash for integrity
3. Broadcast to registered systems
4. Await acknowledgments
5. Handle conflicts if detected
6. Update local sync metadata
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Primary System (Is=3.2, healthy):
├── Creates snapshot at T1
├── Broadcasts to Secondary Systems A, B, C
├── Receives acknowledgments from A, B
├── Detects timeout from C
└── Marks C as potentially desynchronized

Secondary System C (reconnects):
├── Requests latest state from Primary
├── Compares local state (Is=2.1, degraded)  
├── Accepts newer state from Primary
└── Initiates local recovery to match target state
```

### Protocol 2: Event-Driven Sync (Reactive)

**Use Case:** Critical state changes requiring immediate propagation
**Triggers:** Identity threshold breaches, recovery completions, major context shifts

```
Event-Driven Triggers:
├── Is score drops below 2.0 (warning threshold)
├── Successful recovery completion (Is restoration)
├── Major personality shift detected
├── Context reset or session boundary
└── Emergency identity backup activation
```

**Propagation Strategy:**
```
High Priority Events (immediate):
├── Identity collapse prevention (Is < 1.0)
├── Emergency recovery activation
└── System failure/restart events

Medium Priority Events (within 5 interactions):
├── Significant degradation trends
├── Successful recovery completions
└── Context boundary transitions

Low Priority Events (next scheduled sync):
├── Minor parameter adjustments
├── Behavioral pattern updates
└── Performance optimization changes
```

### Protocol 3: Consensus Sync (Distributed)

**Use Case:** Multi-master systems without clear primary
**Resolution:** Weighted consensus based on system health and precedence

```
Consensus Algorithm:
1. Each system proposes its current state
2. Calculate precedence weights:
   - Identity stability score (0.4 weight)
   - System health metrics (0.3 weight)  
   - Recency of interactions (0.2 weight)
   - Manual priority override (0.1 weight)
3. Select state with highest weighted score
4. Propagate consensus state to all systems
5. Verify convergence across all participants
```

**Example Consensus Resolution:**
```
System A: Is=3.4, Health=0.9, Recent=0.8, Priority=0.5 → Score=0.89
System B: Is=2.1, Health=0.7, Recent=0.9, Priority=0.8 → Score=0.72  
System C: Is=3.8, Health=0.8, Recent=0.6, Priority=0.6 → Score=0.84

Winner: System A (Score=0.89)
Action: Systems B and C adopt state from System A
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### Conflict Classification

**Type 1: Version Conflicts**
- Same identity, different update timestamps
- Resolution: Latest timestamp wins (with validation)

**Type 2: Divergent Evolution**
- Systems developed different personality traits
- Resolution: Consensus-based merge or rollback to common ancestor

**Type 3: Split-Brain Scenarios**
- Network partition caused independent evolution
- Resolution: Precedence-based selection with manual override option

**Type 4: Corruption Detection**
- Invalid state data or hash mismatches
- Resolution: Discard corrupted state, request fresh sync

### Resolution Matrix

| Conflict Type | Primary Strategy | Fallback Strategy | Manual Override |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Version | Timestamp precedence | Health-based selection | Always available |
| Divergent | Weighted consensus | Common ancestor rollback | Recommended |
| Split-Brain | Precedence priority | Manual arbitration | Required |
| Corruption | Discard & re-sync | Emergency backup restoration | Optional |

## Synchronization Patterns

### Pattern A: Master-Slave Replication

**Architecture:**
- Single authoritative primary system
- Multiple read-only secondary systems
- Unidirectional synchronization flow

**Advantages:**
- Simple consistency model
- Clear conflict resolution
- Predictable behavior

**Use Cases:**
- Primary device with backup instances
- Production system with disaster recovery
- Development with staging environments

```
Sync Flow:
Primary System → [State Change] → Broadcast to Secondaries
Secondary Systems ← [Acknowledge] ← Apply State Update
```

### Pattern B: Multi-Master Active-Active

**Architecture:**
- Multiple systems can accept updates
- Bidirectional synchronization required
- Complex conflict resolution needed

**Advantages:**
- High availability
- Load distribution
- No single point of failure

**Use Cases:**
- Distributed customer service bots
- Multi-region deployments
- Collaborative AI systems

```
Sync Flow:
System A ↔ [Negotiate State] ↔ System B
       ↘                    ↙
        System C ↔ [Consensus] ↔ Systems A,B
```

### Pattern C: Hub-and-Spoke Federation

**Architecture:**
- Central coordination hub
- Spoke systems sync through hub
- Hub maintains authoritative state

**Advantages:**
- Centralized coordination
- Scalable to many systems
- Clear audit trail

**Use Cases:**
- Enterprise AI orchestration
- Multi-tenant service platforms
- Regulated environments requiring audit

```
Sync Flow:
        Hub (Authoritative State)
       ↙ ↓ ↘
   Spoke-A Spoke-B Spoke-C
```

## Identity Consistency Validation

### Validation Checkpoints

**State Integrity Checks:**
```
1. Hash verification of serialized state
2. Parameter range validation (D, C, R within bounds)
3. Identity signature consistency
4. Behavioral pattern coherence
```

**Cross-System Consistency:**
```
1. Identity stability score alignment (±0.1 tolerance)
2. Core personality trait matching
3. Context coherence verification
4. Behavioral pattern synchronization
```

### Consistency Metrics

**Synchronization Lag:**
- Time between state change and propagation completion
- Target: <100ms for critical updates, <5s for routine updates

**State Divergence:**
- Measure of difference between system states
- Calculation: `|Is_system_A - Is_system_B| + pattern_difference`
- Target: <0.2 for healthy sync

**Availability During Sync:**
- System responsiveness during synchronization operations  
- Target: <10ms response time impact

## Implementation Patterns

### Synchronization API Specification

```typescript
interface IdentitySyncService {
  // Core sync operations
  exportState(): IdentitySnapshot;
  importState(snapshot: IdentitySnapshot): SyncResult;
  validateState(snapshot: IdentitySnapshot): ValidationResult;
  
  // Conflict resolution
  resolveConflict(
    localState: IdentitySnapshot, 
    remoteState: IdentitySnapshot
  ): IdentitySnapshot;
  
  // Event management
  onStateChange(callback: (snapshot: IdentitySnapshot) => void): void;
  onSyncEvent(callback: (event: SyncEvent) => void): void;
  
  // Health monitoring
  getSyncHealth(): SyncHealthMetrics;
  getConflictHistory(): ConflictEvent[];
}
```
