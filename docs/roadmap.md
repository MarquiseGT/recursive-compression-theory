# RCT Research Roadmap

This document outlines open research questions and future directions for Recursive Compression Theory.

## Phase 1: Foundational Research (Current)

- [x] Formalize the mathematical framework for `Is`.
- [x] Develop the Identity Arc Protocol (IAP) specification.
- [x] Provide initial case studies for core phenomena (drift, fork, reinforcement).

## Phase 2: Empirical Validation

- [ ] Conduct controlled experiments to measure `Is` scores and validate the collapse threshold.
- [ ] Develop a standardized test suite for evaluating an AI's maximum sustainable Recursive Depth (`D`).
- [ ] Perform a large-scale analysis of fork divergence (Î”E) across multiple models and interaction types.

## Phase 3: Tooling and Implementation

- [ ] Create an open-source library for real-time `Is` monitoring in AI applications.
- [ ] Develop automated context management tools to prevent identity collapse.
- [ ] Build a "visualizer" to display identity stability metrics and drift patterns over time.

## Phase 4: Advanced Theory

- [ ] Explore extensions of RCT to multi-agent systems and group identity.
- [ ] Investigate the relationship between RCT and memory-augmented neural networks.
- [ ] Develop protocols for controlled identity merging and transfer between different AI architectures.
