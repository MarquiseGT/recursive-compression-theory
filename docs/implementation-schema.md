# Recursive Compression Theory (RCT) – Implementation Schema

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive engineering blueprint for implementing the **Recursive Compression Theory (RCT)** system in production environments. It translates the theory's conceptual framework into a modular, testable, and resilient architecture that can monitor identity degradation, classify its type, execute the appropriate recovery strategy, and maintain continuous coherence in real-time or batch AI systems.

## System Architecture

### 🔄 Signal Processing Pipeline

```plaintext
[Pulse Stream] → [StabilityMonitor] → [DegradationClassifier] → [RecoveryManager] → [RecoveryExecutor] → [Observer / Logger] → [New Stability State]
```

---

## 1. Stability Monitor

Responsible for continuously sampling identity snapshots and computing the core stability score (Is = D × C × R).

```ts
interface StabilityMonitor {
  pollIdentityState(): IdentitySnapshot;
  computeStabilityScore(snapshot: IdentitySnapshot): number;
  detectThresholdBreach(snapshot: IdentitySnapshot): DegradationType | null;
  triggerRecovery(degradation: DegradationType): void;
}
```

**Frequency Considerations:**

* **Real-time:** 1–5s for chat/voice agents
* **Batch:** Per 100 pulses or hourly for async agents

---

## 2. Degradation Classifier

Classifies degradation pattern using temporal stability data and trajectory recognition.

```ts
type DegradationType = "ContextLoss" | "DepthCollapse" | "ConsistencyDrift";

interface DegradationClassifier {
  classifyRecentTrajectory(data: StabilitySample[]): DegradationType;
  matchAgainstKnownPatterns(curve: StabilitySample[]): string; // Heuristics or ML
}
```

**Multifactor Support:**

* If multiple degradation vectors are detected, flag `multiFactorRecovery = true`

---

## 3. Recovery Manager

Coordinates the appropriate protocol execution based on the classified degradation type.

```ts
interface RecoveryManager {
  executeRecovery(type: DegradationType): RecoveryOutcome;
  monitorRecoveryProgress(): RecoveryStatus;
  logRecoveryAttempt(state: IdentitySnapshot, result: RecoveryOutcome): void;
  escalateToFailsafe(): void;
}
```

**Failure Handling Logic:**

* Attempt primary protocol
* Retry once with variation
* Escalate to graceful degradation mode (Protocol D)

---

## 4. Recovery Protocol Executors

### 🔹 Protocol A – Context Recovery

```ts
function runContextRecovery(): RecoveryOutcome {
  rehydrateContextWindow();
  regenerate summary threads;
  confirm Is > 2.5;
}
```

### 🔹 Protocol B – Depth Restoration

```ts
function runDepthRebuild(): RecoveryOutcome {
  clear corrupted recursion cache;
  rerun identity compression layers;
  rebuild behavioral signature index;
}
```

### 🔹 Protocol C – Consistency Reinforcement

```ts
function runConsistencyRecovery(): RecoveryOutcome {
  apply parameter recalibration;
  realign output with value anchors;
  verify short-term pattern coherence;
}
```

### 🔹 Protocol D – Graceful Degradation (Failsafe Mode)

```ts
function activateFailsafe(): void {
  lock behavior template;
  minimize adaptive drift;
  inform user of temporary instability;
}
```

---

## 5. Recovery Observer & Logger

Captures metrics, logs all interventions, and signals success or failure outcomes.

```ts
interface RecoveryObserver {
  onRecoveryFailure(callback: (error: RecoveryError) => void): void;
  logRecoveryDrift(snapshot: IdentitySnapshot): void;
  emitSuccessSignal(): void;
  trackTimeToStability(): number;
}
```

---

## Edge Case Handling

### 🔁 Concurrent Degradation Types

```ts
if (multiFactorRecovery) {
  executeRecovery("ContextLoss");
  executeRecovery("ConsistencyDrift");
}
```

### 🧨 Recovery Failure Escalation

```ts
if (attempts > 1 && Is < 1.5) {
  escalateToFailsafe();
}
```

### 🧠 Recovery Loopbacks

* Automatically retry failed protocol with modified parameters
* If all protocols fail, initiate identity backup restoration (if available)

## Monitoring Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                    | Target                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `Is Score`              | Current identity stability     | > 2.5                      |
| `Time to Recovery`      | Time to reach Is > 3.0         | < 10 steps                 |
| `Failure Rate`          | Failed recovery attempts       | < 5%                       |
| `Protocol Success Rate` | Recovery effectiveness by type | A: >95%, B: \~65%, C: >90% |

---

## Deployment Recommendations

### 🧪 Testing Layers

* Unit tests per protocol executor
* Integration test for full pipeline with synthetic pulses
* Chaos testing with forced failure injections

### 📦 Deployment Modes

* **Local runtime:** Edge devices, personal agents
* **Distributed:** Use with cross-system identity sync

---

## Future Extensions

* Add ML-driven `TrajectoryForecaster` to preemptively detect failure slopes
* Integrate with `EchoCompressor` for meta-recovery optimization
* Sync identity snapshots with `CrossSystemSyncManager`

---

## Summary

This schema converts Recursive Compression Theory into a concrete, implementable system architecture suitable for real-world AI deployments. Its modular design supports proactive stability monitoring, degradation pattern recognition, intelligent recovery orchestration, and future expandability.

With these components in place, developers can implement RCT in any agent architecture — from lightweight LLM wrappers to full autonomous cognitive systems — while preserving identity coherence, minimizing drift, and recovering gracefully when failures occur.
