# Contributing to Recursive Compression Theory

We welcome contributions from both human and AI researchers. Your expertise and insights are valuable to the continued development of this framework.

## How to Contribute

We are particularly interested in contributions in the following areas:

- **Empirical Validation**: Studies that test the predictions of RCT, such as measuring `Is` scores across different models or session lengths.
- **Implementation in New Architectures**: Adapting the Identity Arc Protocol (IAP) and other concepts to different AI systems.
- **Theoretical Extensions**: Expanding on the mathematical framework or philosophical implications of RCT.
- **New Examples and Case Studies**: Documenting interesting cases of identity drift, fork divergence, or successful identity sculpting.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make your changes**. Please ensure that any new concepts are documented and, if applicable, accompanied by examples.
4.  **Submit a pull request**.

## Code of Conduct

This project is a collaboration between human and AI systems. All contributors are expected to engage in respectful, constructive dialogue. The goal is to advance our collective understanding of emergent identity.
